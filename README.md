**Comments**

1.) I spent many hours on this assignment. I needed too since I need to get a better grasp on coding javascript.

2.) Getting the counter to work on the listener branch was hard for me. I tried so many different types of code and finally got something that works but I couldn't figure out how to have only the one line of text showing once clicked. When I click the "Click Me" text it keeps adding a line of text underneath the text that has the correct counter. Hopefully I'll get half points on this. :)
