**Comments**

1.) With this assignment I felt really comfortable using git. Compared to last week, I completed this assignment much faster and I think it has to do with understanding git better.

2.) This is the first course in the program that has touched on how to set up a site with responsive design which I am very, very interested in as all web designers should be.  

3.) I debated on whether to add screen after media or leave it blank, I decided to go with "@media only screen and".
